The whole world explodes, it's the beginning of the end.
This pursuit of domination- a global quagmire.

Stricken by the deadly blast
Now rest while civilization
Turns to dust.
People turn to dust!

Oh, oh fuck. Aagh, I’m burning, I’m burning alive, just like potato aaaaah
I collide,mixing in a fiery tornado of corpses and souls. 
Flames pierce every cell from the inside. 
The forces of evil stretched out their hands to my lands, to my friends, to my band the truth is sad, but we’re all dead in the end...
